In this lesson, we will look at some simple ways for improving the performance of Python programs. 
As you work through the episodes, you will get the opportunity to try out each of the techniques 
and observe the results. The idea is not to get through the work as quickly as possible, but rather 
to understand the reasoning behind the improvements so you can apply them to other Python programs.

> ## Prerequisites
>
> The examples in this lesson can be run directly using the Python interpreter, using IPython interactively, 
> or using Jupyter notebooks.
